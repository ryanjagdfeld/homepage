# ![Introduction](https://ryanjagdfeld.com/Portals/1/images/introduction.png)
I've been designing and creating websites and apps for years, but I've always done it for clients.  Nothing to publish, nothing to make public.  There are reasons this wasn't so bad. Owning my own company, setting my own hours, run the projects from top to bottom (or front to back).  However, I feel like I've been creating in a void. Many times I've tried to get more into open source. I'd start contributing, but it was spars. These repos and this GitHub account are my beginnings into doing more to contribute to all those that helped me learn so much and get here.
