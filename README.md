I will be using this project as a main page about me, but also test various GitHub features and write about what I'm using them for.  It is and will continue to always be a work in process.  

## Education
I'm a graduate from UW Whitewater in the School of Letters and Science for Management Computer Systems.  At the time I graduated the internet was just coming to life, the bubble was forming, and I lived with 3 other guys that all worked in tech in some fashion. My greatest educational experience over formal education was in the form of my first promotion to manager at a small tech company in the early 2000s, Modern Business Technologies. Servicing everything from client PCs to helping configure networks to customizing modules in IIS and SharePoint.

I left the management position, did some contract IT work for a while and then partnered with a friend to do more IT projects. DigitalTech LLC.  It didn't last long.  We had different point of views on what we were building, a common partnership issue, and we ended it within a couple years.  I opened Yog-IT right after. 

Starting my own company is also another educational experience I rank very high in importance.  I started Yog-IT LLC in 2005 as simply what it was, a Limited Liability Corporation to cover my ass..ets. Since that time, I have branched into reselling online hosting, email and marketing products, customized websites and developing apps.  

## Getting Here
I've been designing and creating websites and apps for years, but I've always done it for someone else.  Nothing to publish, nothing to make public.  There are reasons this wasn't so bad. Owning my own company, setting my own hours, run the projects from top to bottom (or front to back).  However, I feel like I've been creating in a void.  So many times I've tried to get more into open source.  These repos and this GitHub account are my beginnings into doing more to contribute to all those that helped me learn so much.
